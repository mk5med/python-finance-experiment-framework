# Experiments
This document lists experiments to run. The format is: 
1. Question / Hypothesis
2. Method of testing or evaluating
3. Method of visualising data

## Experiment 1: How much yield does a 50 day moving average give?
Question: How much yield does a 50 day moving average give?

Method of test:
1. Run a 50 day moving average simulation on many tickers
2. Record the profits for each profit event
3. Record the yield for each profit event: `profit / investment_cost`

Method of visualising data:
1. Plot yield for a ticker over time
2. Plot yield for a ticker by month
3. Plot yield for a ticker by season
4. Plot the average time-to-yield for each ticker
